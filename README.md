# desktopsim
The source code for a "desktop simulation" style game.
This code seeks to replicate a simple "90s Windows" style computer interface. The code includes:
-Pop-up windows that can be opened with icons or through menus. These can be re-prioritized when a background window is clicked on
-A simple markup system to parse plaintext to formatted text for "web pages", with images and hyperlinks
-"Applications" including a file explorer, minigames, a browser, a .ZIP extraction wizard, and more
